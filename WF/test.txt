There will never be anyone else like you in the future of the universe. That's why being yourself is more important than anything else.
宇宙中再不会有一个人和你一样。这就是为什么做自己比什么都重要。

That's how life works: two steps forward, followed by one-and-a-half back as those who lost their power try to reverse the process.
生活就是这样：向前迈两步，接着后退一步半，而失去权势的人努力想要逆转这个顺序。
